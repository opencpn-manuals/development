= Legacy Plugins

The term _Legacy Plugins_ refers to plugins installed without involving the
Plugin Manager or any other part of the OpenCPN core. This was the only
way to deploy plugins before the new Plugin Manager in 5.2.2.

Packages was deployed as NSIS installers in Windows, .img packages on
MacOS and Debian .deb packages on Debian/Ubuntu. There was no flatpak
legacy plugins. Users installed these packages in the same way as OpenCPN
and other programs are installed.

The support for legacy plugins was removed in version 5.8.0; from this point 
the Plugin Manager is the only way to install plugins.
