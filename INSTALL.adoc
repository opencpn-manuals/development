= Building the development manual

The manual can be built locally or published on Github Pages

== Publish to Github Pages

Push the current branch to the branch _build_, something like

    $ git push -f origin HEAD:build

The results becomes available at https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/development
after about 2-3  minutes.

== Local builds

Local builds requires Nodejs and Antora installed. See
https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/

With these tools in place, build using

    $ antora site.yml

The resulting website is placed in the directory docs/. Check the
results by pointing the browser to the _docs/index.html_ file.
